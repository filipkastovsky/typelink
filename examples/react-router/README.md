# React Router manual route declaration example

In this example we will utilize manual route declaration to define type-safe routes for our project. This project was bootstrapped with [`vite`](https://vitejs.dev/) and modified to demonstrate the usage of `@typelink/core`. Pages and examples inspired by `next-t3-watcher` example.

## (Optional) Automatic route discovery

It is possible to use `@typelink/watcher` with the exact same config as in `next-t3-watcher` example! `typelink` does not care what framework you use, if you structure your project in a way that `@typelink/watcher` can find your routes, it will always work.
