# T3 watcher example

In this example we will utilize `@typelink/watcher` to generate type-safe routes for our project. This project was bootstrapped with [`create-t3-app`](https://create.t3.gg/) and slightly modified to demonstrate the usage of `@typelink/watcher`.

Modifications include:

- Haphazardly adding some pages to demonstrate route generation
- ABSOLUTE SAVAGE ctrl+c of a [FlowBite header](https://flowbite.com/blocks/marketing/header/) without including any of the js (the dropdown menu will not work xd) AND without any regards to the already present styling.
